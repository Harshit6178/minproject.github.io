            <h3><strong>1) What is a Tree data structure?</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="in">A Tree is a <strong>non-linear data structure</strong> and a hierarchy consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).</p></li>
                <li><p class="in">This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another. </p> </li> 
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>2) Why Tree Data Structure?</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <p class="in">Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.<br><br>
                Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <br>
         
            <h3><strong>3) Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure:</strong></h3>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Parent Node:</strong>The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {B} is the parent node of {D, E}.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Child Node:</strong>The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Examples: {D, E} are the child nodes of {B}.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Root Node:</strong> The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node. {A} is the root node of the tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Leaf Node or External Node: </strong>The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. {K, L, M, N, O, P} are the leaf nodes of the tree.
               </li><br>
               <li><strong>Ancestor of a Node:</strong>Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node. {A,B} are the ancestor nodes of the node {E}</li><br>
               <li><strong>Descendant:</strong>Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node. {E,I} are the descendants of the node {B}.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Sibling:</strong>Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {D,E} are called siblings.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Level of a node: </strong> The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Internal node: </strong>A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Neighbour of a Node:</strong>Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.</li><br>
               <li><strong>Subtree: </strong>Any node of the tree along with its descendant.</li><br>

                
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3><strong>4) Properties of a Tree:</strong></h3>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Number of edges:</strong> An edge can be defined as the connection between two nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges. There is only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.</li><br>

               <li><strong>Depth of a node:</strong> The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node.</li><br>

               <li><strong>Height of a node: </strong> The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.</li><br>

               <li><strong>Height of the Tree:</strong>The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.
               </li><br>

               <li><strong>Degree of a Node: </strong> The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0. The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree.</li><br>           
            </ul>

                        <p class="in"><strong>1. General : </strong><br>A general tree data structure has no restriction on the number of nodes. It means that a parent node can have any number of child nodes.  </p>
                        <p class="in"><strong>2. Binary tree : </strong><br>A node of a binary tree can have a maximum of two child nodes. In the given tree diagram, node B, D, and F are left children, while E, C, and G are the right children. </p>
                        <p class="in"><strong>3. Balanced tree : </strong><br>If the height of the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree is equal or differs at most by 1, the tree is known as a balanced tree.  </p>
                        <p class="in"><strong>4. Binary search tree : </strong><br>As the name implies, binary search trees are used for various searching and sorting algorithms. The examples include AVL tree and red-black tree. It is a non-linear data structure. It shows that the value of the left node is less than its parent, while the value of the right node is greater than its parent.</p>
